Andrew Cvitanovich CIS 314 Assignment 8

(Question 1)

(A) There are 1024 total writes. Each assignment to an int variable in a
struct of the array corresponds with a movl instruction that writes to
memory. Thus, the number of writes is 4*16*16 = 1024.

(B) 128 of the memory writes result in cache misses. This is because
each cache block will hold the memory contents of two of the color value
structs. Since the cache is initially empty a miss will occur for every
other traversal of the inner loop of the function, because two adjacent
elements of the array are stored in the cache as a block for each miss.
The cache will be completely full once half of the matrix has been
processed, since only half the matrix of color values can fit in the
cache (each struct contains 16 bytes, and each cache block holds 2
structs, but there are only 64 cache lines so only 128 of the 256
structs can be stored in the cache at once). Thus, once the cache has no
more empty lines, the blocks will have to be overwritten with new data.
This means that as the last half of the array is written to there will
also be a miss for every other traversal of the inner loop. Since the
inner loop is traversed 256 times, the number of cache misses will be
128.

(C) The miss rate is 12.5% based on the conclusions of parts (A) and (C).
